# Punch UI

UI component library based on ofa.js development

## Directory Structure

- packages: All source code for components is placed here.

### Notes

Some parts of the component styles use Less; you can install Easy LESS in VSCode to use it.

Avoid overly complex Less usage; simple features like nesting are sufficient.
